Your data is your own.

The browser extensions that I make only request the permissions required to carry out their stated purpose.

I don't do anything else with your data. I don't see it. I don't take it. I don't sell it on or make it available to anyone else in any way.

All of the source code for my browser extensions is available in the relevant repositories on my GitHub account, so you (or a friend) can verify these statements. Alternatively, you could view the source code in your browser extensions folder.

I may add Google Analytics to the extensions in the future, but that would only be to collect anonymised information to help me prioritise any future improvements.
